## Disclaimer

### General Disclaimer

This project is shared **as-is, without warranty of any kind**. The authors and contributors make no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the information, designs, or software provided.

### User Responsibility

**Each person is responsible for:**
- Assembling and using their own WSPR Beakon system
- Ensuring compliance with local radio regulations and laws
- Obtaining proper amateur radio licensing where required
- Using appropriate RF filtering and safety measures
- Testing and verifying the performance of their assembly

### Regulatory Compliance

:::danger Regulatory Requirements
**YOU MUST comply with your local radio regulations** before operating any WSPR Beakon system. This includes but is not limited to:

- **Amateur Radio License**: Valid license required for transmission
- **Power Limitations**: Respect local power limits for each band
- **Spurious Emissions**: Mandatory use of appropriate filtering
- **Band Plans**: Operate only within designated WSPR frequencies
- **Identification**: Proper station identification as required by law
:::

### RF Safety and Filtering

:::warning Mandatory RF Filtering
**THE USE OF APPROPRIATE RF FILTERING IS ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY.** The Si5351 module generates harmonics that must be filtered before connecting to any antenna system. Failure to use proper filtering may:

- Cause interference to other radio services
- Violate regulatory requirements
- Result in legal penalties
- Damage other equipment
:::

### Power Supply Safety

:::warning Electrical Safety
- Use appropriate power supplies rated for the circuit requirements
- Disconnect external power before connecting programming cables
