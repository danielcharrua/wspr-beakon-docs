# Kit Options

This section presents the available kit options for the WSPR Beakon project, designed to simplify the acquisition process and ensure compatibility of all components.

## Why Choose a Kit?

Building a WSPR Beakon from individual components can be challenging due to:

- **Component sourcing** from multiple suppliers
- **Compatibility verification** between different parts
- **Shipping costs** from various vendors
- **Quality assurance** of individual components
- **Time investment** in research and procurement

Our carefully curated kits solve these challenges by providing pre-selected, tested, and compatible components in convenient packages.

## Available Kit Options

## What's Not Included

All kits focus on the core electronics and mechanical components. The following items are not included and must be sourced separately:

- **Filters** - Due to the variety of bands and personal preferences
- **Antennas** - Highly dependent on installation requirements
- **External power supplies** - Varies based on configuration needs
- **Coaxial cables** - Length and type depend on installation

:::info Filter Information
Filters must be built according to the specifications in the [Filters](/docs/filters) section. Component values are provided, but individual calibration is required for optimal performance.
